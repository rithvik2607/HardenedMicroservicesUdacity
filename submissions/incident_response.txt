1. Incident commander name:
Sai Rithvik Ayithapu

2. Executive Summary of what happened:
Three crypto mining pods of unknown source were launched on the RKE cluster. The crypto miners were moneropool, minergate and cryptotonight.

3. Summary of what was affected:
Hackers were able to access our Kubernetes clusters and launched crypto mining containers. Their goal was to use our server resources to mine
cryptocurrencies. 

4. Summmry of the impact:
The responsiveness of the system was affected. Calls to the kubectl API increased, CPU utilization rose to 99% and memory was overloaded.
Because of all this the server became irresponsive and laggy.

5. Summary of the remediation steps:
The falco exporter detected 3 suspicious Kube API calls which were made to create the crypto mining pods. Along with that there was a sudden
and unexpected increase in the server resource utilization through the Kubernetes Compute Resources in Grafana. Thus, the 3 crypto mining pods
were identified and deleted.

6. Summary of lessons learned:
Kubernetes cluster is not secure out of the box. Necessary measures must be taken to secure and harden the cluster. Audits should be conducted
from time to time to ensure security of the cluster. Access origin of the Kube API server must also be investigated. Unknown containers running
on our cluster should be discouraged using admission controllers.
