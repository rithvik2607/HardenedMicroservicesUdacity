== Remediations ==
1.1.1 You may consider various CIS Security Benchmarks for your container host. 
If you have other security guidelines or regulatory requirements 
to adhere to, please follow them as suitable in your environment. 

1.1.2 You should monitor versions of Docker releases and make sure
your software is updated as required.

1.2.1 For new installations, you should create a separate partition for the /var/lib/docker mount point.
For systems which have already been installed, 
you should use the Logical Volume Manager (LVM)
within Linux to create a new partition.

1.2.2 You should remove any untrusted users from the docker group. 
Additionally, you should not create a mapping of sensitive directories from the host to container volumes."

2.1 Edit the Docker daemon configuration file to ensure that icc is disabled. It should include
the following setting
"icc": false
Alernatively, run the docker daemon directly and pass --icc=false as an argument. 
For Example, 
dockerd --icc=false

2.2.b grep: /etc/docker/daemon.json: No such file or directory

2.4 You should ensure that no insecure registries are in use.

2.6.a Follow the steps mentioned in the Docker documentation or other references.

2.6.b Follow the steps mentioned in the Docker documentation or other references.

2.7 Run the docker in daemon mode and pass --default-ulimit as argument with respective
ulimits as appropriate in your environment.
For Example,
dockerd --default-ulimit nproc=1024:2048 --default-ulimit nofile=100:200

2.8 Please consult the Docker documentation for various ways in which this can be configured 
depending upon your requirements. Your steps might also vary based on platform - For 
example, on Red Hat, sub-UIDs and sub-GIDs mapping creation do not work automatically.
You might have to create your own mapping.
The high-level steps are as below: 
Step 1: Ensure that the files /etc/subuid and /etc/subgid exist.
touch /etc/subuid /etc/subgid
Step 2: Start the docker daemon with --userns-remap flag 
dockerd --userns-remap=default

2.11.a Step 1: Install/Create an authorization plugin.
Step 2: Configure the authorization policy as desired.
Step 3: Start the docker daemon as below:
dockerd --authorization-plugin=<PLUGIN_ID>

2.12 Step 1: Setup the desired log driver by following its documentation.
Step 2: Start the docker daemon with that logging driver.
For example,
dockerd --log-driver=syslog --log-opt syslog-address=tcp://192.xxx.xxx.xxx

2.13.a Run the docker in daemon mode and pass --live-restore as an argument.
For Example,
dockerd --live-restore

2.13.b Run the docker in daemon mode and pass --live-restore as an argument.
For Example,
dockerd --live-restore

2.14.a You should run the Docker daemon as below:
dockerd --userland-proxy=false

2.14.b You should run the Docker daemon as below:
dockerd --userland-proxy=false

2.17.a You should run the Docker daemon as below:
dockerd --no-new-privileges

2.17.b For example, you should start your container as below:
docker run --rm -it --security-opt=no-new-privileges ubuntu bash

3.7 stat: cannot stat '/etc/docker/certs.d/*': No such file or directory

3.8 stat: cannot stat '/etc/docker/certs.d/*': No such file or directory

3.9 You should execute the following command:
chown root:root <path to TLS CA certificate file>
This sets the individual ownership and group ownership for the TLS CA certificate file to root.

3.10 You should execute the following command: chmod 444 <path to TLS CA certificate file>
chmod 444 <path to TLS CA certificate file>
This sets the file permissions on the TLS CA file to 444.

3.11 You should run the following command:
chown root:root <path to Docker server certificate file>
This sets the individual ownership and the group ownership for the Docker server
certificate file to root.

3.12 You should execute the command below:
chmod 444 <path to Docker server certificate file>
This sets the file permissions of the Docker server certificate file to 444 .

3.13 You should execute the following command:
chown root:root <path to Docker server certificate key file>
This sets the individual ownership and group ownership for the Docker server certificate
key file to root.

3.14 You should execute the following command:
chmod 400 <path to Docker server certificate key file>
This sets the Docker server certificate key file permissions to 400 .

3.17 You should execute the command below:
chown root:root /etc/docker/daemon.json
This sets the ownership and group-ownership for the file to root .

3.18 You should execute the command below
chmod 644 /etc/docker/daemon.json
This sets the file permissions for this file to 644.

3.20 You should execute the following command
chown root:root /etc/sysconfig/docker
This  sets the ownership and group-ownership for the file to root .

3.21 You should execute the following command:
chmod 644 /etc/sysconfig/docker
This sets the file permissions for this file to 644.

4.1 You should ensure that the Dockerfile for each container image contains the information below:
USER <username or ID>
In this case, the user name or ID refers to the user that was found in the container base
image. If there is no specific user created in the container base image, then make use of the
useradd command to add a specific user before the USER instruction in the Dockerfile.
For example, add the below lines in the Dockerfile to create a user in the container:
RUN useradd -d /home/username -m -s /bin/bash username
USER username
Note: If there are users in the image that are not needed, you should consider deleting
them. After deleting those users, commit the image and then generate new instances of the
containers.
Alternatively, if it is not possible to set the USER directive in the Dockerfile, a script running
as part of the CMD or ENTRYPOINT sections of the Dockerfile should be used to ensure that
the container process switches to a non-root user.

4.2 The following procedures are useful for establishing trust for a specific image.
- Configure and use Docker Content trust.
- View the history of each Docker image to evaluate its risk, dependent on the
  sensitivity of the application you wish to deploy using it.
- Scan Docker images for vulnerabilities at regular intervals.

4.3 You should not install anything within the container that is not required.
You should consider using a minimal base image rather than the standard
Redhat/Centos/Debian images if you can. Some of the options available include BusyBox
and Alpine.
Not only can this trim your image size considerably, but there would also be fewer pieces of
software which could contain vectors for attack.

4.4 Images should be re-built ensuring that the latest version of the base images are used, to
keep the operating system patch level at an appropriate level. Once the images have been
re-built, containers should be re-started making use of the updated images.

4.5 To enable content trust in a bash shell, enter the following command:
export DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1
Alternatively, you could set this environment variable in your profile file so that content 
trust in enabled on every login.

4.6 You should follow the Docker documentation and rebuild your container images to include
the HEALTHCHECK instruction.

4.7 You should use update instructions together with install instructions and version pinning
for packages while installing them. This prevent caching and force the extraction of the
required versions.
Alternatively, you could use the --no-cache flag during the docker build process to avoid
using cached layers.

4.8 You should allow setuid and setgid permissions only on executables which require them.
You could remove these permissions at build time by adding the following command in
your Dockerfile, preferably towards the end of the Dockerfile:
RUN find / -perm /6000 -type f -exec chmod a-s {} \; || true

4.9 You should use COPY rather than ADD instructions in Dockerfiles.

4.10 Do not store any kind of secrets within Dockerfiles. Where secrets are required during the 
build process, make use of a secrets management tool, such as the buildkit builder included 
with Docker.

4.11 You should use a secure package distribution mechanism of your choice to ensure the 
authenticity of software packages.

5.1 If AppArmor is applicable for your Linux OS, you should enable it.
      1. Verify if AppArmor is installed. If not, install it.
      2. Create or import a AppArmor profile for Docker containers.
      3. Put this profile in enforcing mode.
      4. Start your Docker container using the customized AppArmor profile. For example,
docker run --interactive --tty --security-opt="apparmor:PROFILENAME" centos
/bin/bash
Alternatively, Docker's default AppArmor policy can be used.

5.2 If SELinux is applicable for your Linux OS, you should use it.
        1. Set the SELinux State.
        2. Set the SELinux Policy.
        3. Create or import a SELinux policy template for Docker containers.
        4. Start Docker in daemon mode with SELinux enabled. For example,
  docker daemon --selinux-enabled
        5. Start your Docker container using the security options. For example,
  docker run --interactive --tty --security-opt label=level:TopSecret centos
  /bin/bash

5.3 You should execute the command below to add required capabilities:
docker run --cap-add={"Capability 1","Capability 2"} <Run arguments>
<Container Image Name or ID> <Command>
You should execute the command below to remove unneeded capabilities:
docker run --cap-drop={"Capability 1","Capability 2"} <Run arguments>
<Container Image Name or ID> <Command>
Alternatively, you could remove all the currently configured capabilities and then restore
only the ones you specifically use:
docker run --cap-drop=all --cap-add={"Capability 1","Capability 2"} <Run
arguments> <Container Image Name or ID> <Command>

5.6 Uninstall the SSH daemon from the container and use and use docker exec to enter a
container on the remote host.
docker exec --interactive --tty $INSTANCE_ID sh
OR
docker attach $INSTANCE_ID

5.7 You should not map container ports to privileged host ports when starting a container. You
should also, ensure that there is no such container to host privileged port mapping
declarations in the Dockerfile.

5.8 You should ensure that the Dockerfile for each container image only exposes needed ports. 
You can also completely ignore the list of ports defined in the Dockerfile by NOT using -P 
(UPPERCASE) or the --publish-all flag when starting the container. Instead, use the -p 
(lowercase) or --publish flag to explicitly define the ports that you need for a particular
container instance.
For example,
docker run --interactive --tty --publish 5000 --publish 5001 --publish 5002
centos /bin/bash

5.17 You should not directly expose host devices to containers. If you do need to expose host
devices to containers, you should use granular permissions as appropriate to your
devices to containers, you should use granular permissions as appropriate to your
For example, do not start a container using the command below:
docker run --interactive --tty --device=/dev/tty0:/dev/tty0:rwm --
device=/dev/temp_sda:/dev/temp_sda:rwm centos bash
You should only share the host device using appropriate permissions:
docker run --interactive --tty --device=/dev/tty0:/dev/tty0:rw --
device=/dev/temp_sda:/dev/temp_sda:r centos bash

5.18 You should only override the default ulimit settings if needed in a specific case.
For example, to override default ulimit settings start a container as below:
docker run --ulimit nofile=1024:1024 --interactive --tty centos /bin/bash

5.19 Do not mount volumes in shared mode propagation.
For example, do not start container as below:
docker run <Run arguments> --volume=/hostPath:/containerPath:shared
<Container Image Name or ID> <Command>

5.22 /bin/sh: 1: ausearch: not found

5.23 /bin/sh: 1: ausearch: not found

5.24 You should not use the --cgroup-parent option within the docker run command unless 
strictly required.

5.25 "docker inspect" requires at least 1 argument.

5.26 You should run the container using the --health-cmd parameter.
For example,
docker run -d --health-cmd='stat /etc/passwd || exit 1' nginx

5.27 You should use proper version pinning mechanisms (the "latest" tag which is assigned by
default is still vulnerable to caching attacks) to avoid extracting cached older versions.
Version pinning mechanisms should be used for base images, packages, and entire images.
You can customize version pinning rules according to your requirements.

5.28 "docker inspect" requires at least 1 argument.
See 'docker inspect --help'.

Usage:  docker inspect [OPTIONS] NAME|ID [NAME|ID...]

5.29 You should follow the Docker documentation and set up a user-defined network. All the
containers should be run in this network.

6.1 You should keep only the images that you actually need and establish a workflow to
remove old or stale images from the host. Additionally, you should use features such as
pull-by-digest to get specific images from the registry.
You can follow the steps below to find unused images on the system so they can be deleted.
Step 1 Make a list of all image IDs that are currently instantiated by executing the
command below:
docker images --quiet | xargs docker inspect --format '{{ .Id }}: Image={{
        .Config.Image }}'
Step 2: List all the images present on the system by executing the command below:
docker images
Step 3: Compare the list of image IDs from Step 1 and Step 2 and look for images that are
currently not in use. If any unused or old images are found, discuss with the system
administrator the need to keep such images on the system. If images are no longer needed
they should be deleted.

6.2 You should periodically check your container inventory on each host and clean up
containers which are not in active use with the command below:
docker container prune

8.1.1 You can configure LDAP integration via the UCP "Admin Settings" UI by following the
instructions here: "https://docs.docker.com/datacenter/ucp/2.2/guides/admin/configure/external-auth/".
LDAP integration can also be enabled via a configuration file by following
the instructions here: "https://docs.docker.com/datacenter/ucp/2.2/guides/admin/configure/external-auth/enable-ldap-config-file/".

8.1.2 You can configure your own certificates for UCP either during installation or after
installation via the UCP "Admin Settings" user interface.
Customize certificates during installation:
1. Create a volume named ucp-controller-server-certs on your primary UCP
   Manager installation node:
docker volume create ucp-controller-server-certs
2. Copy your external certificate authority's public certificate file (ca.pem) and your
   signed certificate (cert.pem) and key (key.pem) files to the root directory of the
   volume
cp ca.pem cert.pem key.pem $(docker volume inspect --format '{{ .Mountpoint
}}' ucp-controller-server-certs)/
3. Run the UCP installation command with the --external-server-cert flag

Customize certificates post-installation via the "Admin Settings" UI:
Refer to the instructions at
https://docs.docker.com/datacenter/ucp/2.2/guides/admin/configure/use-your-own-tls-
certificates/#configure-ucp-to-use-your-own-tls-certificates-and-keys for configuring your
own certificates via the UCP UI.

8.1.3 Client certificate bundles can be created in one of two ways:
User Management UI
UCP Administrators can provision client certificate bundles on behalf of users by navigating
to the USER MANAGEMENT | USERS interface in UCP, selecting the user from the list,
clicking on the "Configure" button from the right-hand navigation, and selecting "Client
Bundle" from the drop-down. The "New Client Bundle" link can be selected to create a
client bundle. This will trigger a download of the bundle as a .zip file.
Self-Provision
Users with access to the UCP console can create client certificate bundles themselves. After
logging into the console, the user can select their username drop-down from the top-left
corner of the navigation page and select the "My Profile" option. From there, the "New
Client Bundle" link can be selected to create a client bundle and this will trigger a download
of the bundle as a .zip file.

8.1.4 UCP RBAC components can be configured as required via the UCP "User Management" UI.

8.1.5 None is mentioned

8.1.6 As a Docker Enterprise Administrator, execute the following commands from a machine
with connectivity to the UCP management console. Replace [ucp_url] with your UCP URL,
[ucp_username] with the username of a Docker Enterprise Administrator and
[ucp_password] with the password of a Docker Enterprise Administrator.
Step 1: Retrieve a UCP API token
Linux (requires curl and jq):
$ AUTHTOKEN=$(curl -sk -d
'{"username":"[ucp_username]","password":"[ucp_password]"}'
https://[ucp_url]/auth/login | jq -r .auth_token)
Step 2: Retrieve and save UCP config
Linux (requires curl):
$ curl -sk -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTHTOKEN"
https://[ucp_url]/api/ucp/config-toml > ucp-config.toml
Step 3: Open the ucp-config.toml file, set the per_user_limit entry under the
[auth.sessions] section to a value of '3' or lower, but greater than '0'. Save the file.
Step 4: Execute the following command to update UCP with the new configuration:
Linux (requires curl):
$ curl -sk -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTHTOKEN" --upload-file ucp-
config.toml https://[ucp_url]/api/ucp/config-toml

8.1.7 As a Docker Enterprise Administrator, execute the following commands from a machine
