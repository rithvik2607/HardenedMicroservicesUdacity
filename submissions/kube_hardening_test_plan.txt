How will you test the changes?
A copy of the production environment can be created. This will be the test environment. The test environment will have the exact same
configurtaion of the production environment. We can run tests on this environment to make sure the system is functioning well. If all
tests are passed, then we can route a small portion of the traffic to the testing environment and make sure everything is working well.
Monitoring through Grafana and Prometheus can be performed to track system performance. Falco events and CPU/memory load can be tracked
as well.

How will you ensure the changes don't negatively affect your cluster?
1. The changes will be tested in the testing environment. 
2. Canary testing where a small percentage of our users will be routed to the testing environment server will be performed.
3. If these two cases pass, then the changes can be deployed to production. The production environment will be monitored using
   Prometheus and Grafana.
4. In case anything goes wrong we can use Git version control to roll back changes. This will need a reboot.
